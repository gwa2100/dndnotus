# DNDNOTUS
DND Notus is meant to be a simple DND Note taking and tracking system for keeping track of your character's thoughts and actions in a campaign.  It allows a DM to also message important things the players would know to all players registered.  This is a work in progress and is meant to be a simple useful tool free for everyone.  Feel free to fork, contribute, and use it!
